# $SING
**Revolutionizing the Music and Arts Industry with Web3 and A.I. Technology**

# Abstract

`$SING` is the world’s first Web3 platform dedicated to the full-lifecycle incubation of music artists, built on the high-performance FullOn public blockchain. It issues the utility ecosystem token `$SING` along with a series of supporting tokens. Through an innovative four-stage artist incubation model, diversified mining mechanisms, and a dual-token economic system, `$SING` provides functional value exchange tools for global music ecosystem participants, driving the music industry toward decentralization and community-driven development. As the native token of the `$SING` platform, `$SING` integrates Web3 and A.I. technologies to create a transparent and fair music economic ecosystem, empowering emerging artists to become global stars and transforming fans from consumers into investors and co-governors.

Additionally, `$SING` efficiently connects artists and fans by minting `Real World Assets` (RWA) for artist growth, copyright distribution, performances, and artist IP, enabling intelligent full-lifecycle management.

> Important Disclaimer: `$SING` is a utility token designed for functional applications and service payments within the ecosystem. It does not represent any company equity, debt, or investment contracts and does not have securities attributes.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Structural Challenges in the Music Industry
The traditional music industry has long faced structural issues such as unequal value distribution, high intermediary costs, and minimal artist profits. While existing Web3 music platforms have introduced decentralization, they commonly encounter the following pain points:

- `Overemphasis on Decentralization`: Ignoring artist belongingness and fan loyalty, which are core elements of the music industry.
- `Singular Business Model`: Primarily reliant on NFT speculation, lacking sustainable revenue models.
- `Poor User Experience`: High technical barriers make it difficult for ordinary users to participate.
- `Insufficient Token Value Support`: Lack of practical use cases and value anchoring.

## 1.2 $SING’s Solution

`$SING` addresses the core pain points of traditional Web3 music platforms through a four-stage artist incubation model, blending Web2 best practices with Web3 technological innovation. As the world’s first Web3 platform focused on the full-lifecycle incubation of music artists (`$SING Artist Incubation Platform`, CAIP), it integrates A.I. analytics, artist growth RWA, copyright distribution RWA, performance RWA, and artist IP RWA, providing end-to-end support from artist discovery to metaverse expansion:

- `Rebuilding Artist Belongingness`: Establishing deep ties between the platform and artists through a signing model.
- `Enhancing Fan Loyalty`: Improving fan loyalty through diverse interactions and profit-sharing mechanisms.
- `Diversified Revenue Models`: Integrating subscriptions, advertising, merchandise, and performances.
- `Practical Value Support`: A revenue-binding mechanism ensures token value is backed by real income.

The core process includes artist discovery and selection (Web2 methods + AI analysis), artist cultivation and development (investment and financing + training + offline tours + RWA), star achievement and commercialization (global tours + brand collaborations + merchandise sales), and digital superstar and metaverse expansion (IP RWA + virtual concerts + blockchain games).

## 1.3 $SING’s Three Core Strategies

**$SING** leverages Web3 and A.I. technologies to empower young artists to achieve their dreams of stardom through three core strategies:

1. **Tokenization of Everything**

| Token         | Type | Use/Rights/Revenue                         | Acquisition Method                              |
|---------------|------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `$SING`       | FT   | Platform-level token for incentivizing ecosystem contributors and supporters | distribute through private sale or `PoH` |
| `$SONG`      | FT  | Credit points for service/content/product consumption, usable for free ticket access | Minted via staking `$SING` or participating in `PoE` activities |
| `Badge NFTs`  | NFT  | Membership levels (e.g., Regular, Silver, Gold, Platinum) | Claimed when `$SONG` consumption reaches specified thresholds |
| `Ticket NFTs` | NFT  | Unique NFT collections for each performance | Obtained through ticket grabs or direct purchase |

2. **Mining of Everything**

**$SING** offers multiple mining mechanisms through Web3, enabling users to earn rewards. From account creation to participation, payments, and staking, every activity generates value in the form of `$SING` or `$SONG` tokens, creating a vibrant ecosystem for artists and fans.

| Mining Type                  | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PoH`: Proof of Registration | Each new account registration will mint `$20` worth of $SING tokens and 100 `$SONG` points. |
| `PoE`: Proof of Engagement   | Participating in artist or project interactions to mine `$SONG` tokens       |
| `PoP`: Proof of Payment      | Payers receive newly minted `$SING` tokens equivalent to `10%` of payment amount |
| `PoS`: Proof of Stake        | `$SING` token stakers will receive interest rewards with a fixed annualized yield based on the selected lock-up period, with rewards in newly minted `$SING` tokens or `$SONG` points. |

> [!NOTE]
> 1. PoH registration uses the RWID technology on the FullOn public blockchain, which binds on-chain accounts to mobile phones or other 
> social factors to simplify user account creation and ensure real users are linked to on-chain accounts, effectively preventing Sybil 
> attacks and arbitrary releases.  
> 2. The amount of $SING equivalent to $20 is calculated based on the current price obtained from the DEX provided by the platform within 
> the FullOn blockchain ecosystem.  
> 3. The platform's reserve pool stores newly minted $SING from PoH activities. Users can purchase directly at the current DEX price without > fees, while purchases on the DEX incur transaction fees.


3. **Fans Investing in Artists**

Fans can become investors and stakeholders in their favorite artists by participating in short-term projects (e.g., live performance events), medium-to-long-term careers (5-10 years, supporting artists to become stars), or lifelong projects (e.g., 3D digital autonomous A.I. agents serving online or on-chain communities). Through investments, fans receive NFT tokens representing shares and earn `$SING` equivalent to 10% of project revenue. Additionally, NFT holders can vote on governance decisions for their invested projects.

## 1.4 $SING’s Positioning and Vision

`$SING` is a pure ecosystem utility token with core value in:
- Serving as a functional tool and value exchange medium within the music ecosystem.
- Incentivizing contributions and creative activities of ecosystem participants.
- Facilitating direct value connections between artists and fans.
- Enabling decentralized governance and community co-building functions.

**$SING** is committed to building a borderless, transparent, and fair music and arts ecosystem. Through blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized governance, we empower artists and their communities to collaboratively create a sustainable, vibrant, and collaborative future. As a pioneering platform, **$SING** helps emerging artists become global stars. Leveraging Web3 and A.I. technologies, we foster authentic connections between artists and fans, promoting interaction, shared success, and unlocking infinite creative possibilities.

</p>

> [!NOTE]
> 1. As the platform expands to global markets, an unlimited number of artist communities can be established.
> 2. Each artist community must contribute 10% of its platform revenue to the platform fund.
> 3. The platform uses the platform fund to buy back and burn `$SING` tokens, creating a continuous deflationary effect.

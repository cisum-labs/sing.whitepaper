`Cisumverse White Paper`

# **Cisumverse**
**Revolutionizing the Music & Arts Industry with Web3 & A.I.**

# Overview

Cisumverse is the world’s first Web3 platform focused on the full lifecycle incubation of music artists (`Cisumverse Artist Incubation Platform`, **CAIP**). Integrating traditional music industry expertise with Web3 technology, it leverages the high-performance FullOn blockchain, a four-stage artist incubation model, CISUM token economics, and smart contracts to create a transparent, fair, and decentralized music economy, fostering new value connections for artists, fans, institutions, and investors.

**Core Processes:**

- **Artist Discovery**: Identifies promising talent through Web2 mechanisms (e.g., global music competitions, label partnerships) and AI-driven analysis.
- **Artist Development**: Offers financing, training, tours, and Web3 fan engagement to boost visibility.
- **Star Commercialization**: Organizes music festivals, global tours, and brand collaborations to elevate artists to regional or global stardom.
- **Metaverse Expansion**: Creates virtual artist avatars, issues NFTs, and develops virtual concerts and blockchain games for cross-platform interaction.

Cisumverse addresses traditional music industry issues like unfair revenue distribution and limited artist growth, while overcoming Web3 music platform challenges (e.g., volatile token values, low NFT liquidity, and insufficient user engagement), driving a revolutionary transformation in the music industry.

# Vision

**Cisumverse** envisions a borderless, transparent, and equitable ecosystem for music and the arts, powered by Web3 technology. By leveraging blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralized governance, we empower artists and their communities to create a sustainable, vibrant, and collaborative future.

As a pioneering platform, **Cisumverse** transforms emerging artists into global stars. Through Web3, we foster authentic connections between artists and their fans, driving engagement, shared success, and limitless creative possibilities.


# Strategy

**Cisumverse** harnesses Web3 and AI technologies to empower young artists to achieve stardom through three core strategies:

1. **Tokenizing everything**

**Cisumverse** transforms assets and opportunities into digital tokens, enabling seamless investment, ownership, and governance.

| Token      |  Type      | Usage/Privileges/Benefits | Ways to acquire                 |
|------------|------------|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `CISUM`    | FT  | A platform-level token to incentivize ecosystem contributors and believers | via private sales or DEX/CEX  |
| `GRAB`     | NFT | Used to grab a free ticket in platform organized ticket-rush sessions | via account registration or inviting other to register on-chain |
| `NESTAR`   | NFT | Used as credit points for spending in services/contents/products, unique for each artists community | via burning CISUM to mint or `PoE` activities |
| Badge NFTs   | NFT | Membership levels denoted by `Common`/`Silver`/`Gold`/`Platinum` etc. badge types | claimable when the quantity level of spent `NESTAR`reaches |
| Ticket NFTs| NFT | Each show has a unique set of ticket NFTs | via ticket-rush sessions or direct purchase |

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to its potential for appreciating financial value, CISUM token holders gain governance rights, participating in platform-wide decision-making through voting processes organized by the Cisum Foundation.
> The ultimate goal for CISUM is to become the settlement medium for music and arts industry and transfer music/arts fans from consumers to shareholders, producers and DAO governors.

2. **Mining everything**

**Cisumverse** enables users to earn rewards through diverse mining mechanisms powered by Web3. From account creation to engagement, payments, and staking, every action generates value in the form of CISUM or STAR tokens, fostering a vibrant ecosystem for artists and fans.

| Mining Type           | Description                                                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|     
| Proof of Head(PoH)    | `CISUM` tokens worth of `$20` will be newly minted upon each new account registration |
| Proof of Engagement(PoE) | Whichever artists or projects engagement activites for minging `NESTAR` tokens.         |  
| Proof of Payment(PoP) | Payers will be rewarded with newly minted `CISUM` tokens worth of `10%` of the paying amount. |
| Proof of Stake(PoS)   | Stakers of `CISUM` tokens will be rewarded with a fixed APY of interest based on their selected locking period duration. The interest rewards are newly minted `CISUM` tokens |

> [!NOTE]
> Example PoE activies include but are not limited to the following:
>  - daily sign-in to an artists community
>  - inviting others to join an artists community
>  - posting/sharing artists events in social medias
>  - Playing artists music
>  - Sharing artists music with others
>  - purchasing artists related items

3. **Fans investing in artists**

Fans can become investors and shareholders in their favorite artists by participating in fundraising for short-term projects (e.g., live events), medium-to-long-term ventures (5–10 years, supporting artists’ rise to stardom), or lifelong initiatives (e.g., 3D Digital Autonomous AI Agents serving online or on-chain communities). By investing, fans receive NFT tokens representing shares, earning CISUM equivalent to 10% of the project’s revenue. Additionally, NFT holders can vote in governance decisions for their invested projects.

</p>


> [!NOTE]
> 1. There can be as many artisits communities as possible as the platform grows to reache the global markets.
> 2. Each artisits community is required to put aside 10% of their platform income as contribution to the platform fund.
> 3. The platform is required to use the platform fund to buy back and burn CISUM tokens to create continuous deflation effect to CISUM.
